### Image Classification
**Description:** This project aims to classify images into different categories using deep learning models such as CNN, ResNet, and VGG16. It supports custom datasets and allows fine-tuning for better accuracy.

**Features:**
- Pre-trained models for improved performance
- Support for multi-class classification
- Model training, validation, and hyperparameter tuning
- Real-time image classification using a web interface
- Confusion matrix and accuracy plots for evaluation

**Setup Instructions:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py --dataset <path_to_dataset>
python predict.py --image <path_to_image>
```
## 📌 General Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed before running any project:
- Python 3.x
- Required dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- GPU support (optional but recommended for deep learning models)
